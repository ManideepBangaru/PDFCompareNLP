Dear JOSHUA PETERS and LISA PETERS
Congratulations! You are eligible for a Modification. If we receive your trial payments as required, timely receive two
copies of the fully executed Modification Agreement and you have met any other requirements set forth in the final
Modification Agreement, we will modify your mortgage loan and waive all prior late charges that remain unpaid.
In order for this modification offer to become enforceable, we must receive the trial payments set forth in the trial
approval letter. If we do not receive any trial payments when due, the modification offer is automatically terminated and
we will not permanently modify the loan.
The enclosed Modification Agreement (“Modification Agreement”) reflects the proposed terms of your modified mortgage.
How to Accept This Offer:
    • Make all remaining trial period payments on or before the dates they are due. If the trial period payments are
         made after their due dates or in amounts different from the trial period payment amount required, your mortgage
         loan will not be modified.
    • Sign and return both original Modification Agreements in the enclosed pre-paid envelope so they are received by
         us on or before June 27, 2019.
    • We encourage you to make a copy of all documents for your records. We will send you a copy of the final
         Modification Agreement signed by us, but in the meantime, we suggest you keep a copy for your records.
    • If we do not receive both copies of the signed original Modification Agreements by the above date, you must
         contact us if you still wish to be considered for this program and to have your loan modified.
For your convenience, we are also enclosing information about our AutoPay program, which, if you are eligible for the
program and choose to participate, would enable you to have your monthly mortgage payments automatically deducted
from the checking or savings account of your choice.

         WHEREAS, JOSHUA PETERS and LISA PETERS (""Borrower"") desires USAA Federal Savings
Bank, serviced by Nationstar Mortgage LLC (""Lender"") to collect payments from Borrower to be held by
Lender for the payment of certain sums due in connection with Borrower’s Note and Security Instrument,
dated ______________, ____, (hereinafter referred to as ""Note"" and ""Security Instrument"" respectively)
currently held by Lender;
         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants contained in this
Agreement (“Agreement”), Borrower agrees to pay Lender, on the day Periodic Payments are due under
the Note, until the Note is paid in full, or the Escrow Account is otherwise terminated pursuant to this
Agreement or in accordance with applicable law, a sum (the “Funds”) to provide for payment of amounts
due for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over the Security Instrument
as a lien or encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if
any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under the Security Instrument; and (d)
Mortgage Insurance Premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment
of Mortgage Insurance premiums. These items are called “Escrow Items.” In the event that Borrower
receives bills, assessments, invoices, or other requests for payment of Escrow Items, Borrower shall
promptly furnish to Lender all such notices.
         Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless this Agreement is terminated either
by Lender, or pursuant to applicable law. In the event of termination, Borrower shall pay directly, when
and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived
by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such
time period as Lender may require. In the event Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, and
Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may pay such amount in accordance
with the terms of the Note and Security Instrument and Borrower shall then be obligated to repay Lender
any such amount. Additionally, if Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, and Borrower fails to
pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may, in accordance with applicable law, require Borrower
to maintain an Escrow Account.
         Borrower agrees to make an initial payment of Funds to establish the escrow account, which
amount shall be based on an estimate of the amount and date of expenditures for future Escrow Items, or
otherwise in accordance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”). The estimate of
expenditures of future Escrow Items shall be made based on current data available to Lender. Borrower
acknowledges that the actual payments of Escrow Items may vary from the estimated amounts.
         Lender will collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds
at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require
under RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and
reasonable estimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with applicable
law.
         The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency,
instrumentality, or entity or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the
Escrow Items no later than the time period specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for
holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items,
unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and applicable law permits Lender to make such a
charge. Unless agreed to in writing or applicable law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender
shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Lender shall give to
Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.
         If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to
Borrower for the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow,
as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to

This authority is voluntary and will remain in effect until I notify Nationstar of my desire to cancel at least 3
business days prior to the next payment draft date or until I receive written notification from Nationstar. I
also have the right to stop payment by notifying my financial institution either verbally or in writing at least
3 business days before the next payment draft date. I understand that if I stop a payment, I am
terminating Autopay and my monthly loan payments will no longer be debited from my account.
I understand I may be assessed a fee for a payment returned unpaid. If your payment is returned unpaid,
we may choose to collect such fee electronically, and if we choose to do so, you authorize us to make a
one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect a fee of up to $30.00.
I also understand I may be assessed a late charge for a missed payment or a payment that is paid after
the date it is due (including after any grace period). If your payment is late, we may choose to collect
such late charge electronically, and if we choose to do so, you authorize us to make a one-time electronic
fund transfer from you account to collect such late charge in accordance with your loan documents.

Mortgage on the Property, and (2) the Note secured by the Mortgage. The Mortgage and Note together,
as they may previously have been amended, are referred to as the “Loan Documents.” Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement and not defined have the meaning given to them in Loan Documents.
I understand that after I sign and return two copies of this Agreement to the Lender, the Lender will send
me a signed copy of this Agreement. This Agreement will not take effect unless the preconditions set
forth in Section 2 have been satisfied.
1. My Representations and Covenants. I certify, represent to Lender, covenant and agree:
      A. I am experiencing a financial hardship, and as a result, (i) I am in default under the Loan
            Documents or my default is imminent, and (ii) I do not have sufficient income or access to

            single-family properties that I own continue to be true and correct on the date hereof, and the
            property has not been condemned;
      C. There has been no impermissible change in the ownership of the Property since I signed the
            Loan Documents. A permissible change would be any transfer that the lender is required by law
            to allow, such as a transfer to add or remove a family member, spouse or domestic partner of the
            undersigned in the event of a death, divorce or marriage;
            Under penalty of perjury, all documents and information I have provided to Lender in connection
            with this Agreement, including the documents and information regarding my eligibility for the , are
            true and correct;
            If Lender requires me to obtain credit counseling in connection with the Program, I will do so; and
            I have made or will make all payments required under a trial period plan.
           In the event that I was discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding subsequent to the
           execution of the loan documents and did not reaffirm the mortgage debt under applicable law,
           Lender agrees that I will not have personal liability on the debt pursuant to this Agreement.
2. Acknowledgements and Preconditions to Modification. I understand and acknowledge that:
      A. If prior to the Modification Effective Date as set forth in Section 3 the Lender determines that any
            of my representations in Section 1 are no longer true and correct or any covenant in Section 1
            has not been performed, the Loan Documents will not be modified and this Agreement will
            terminate. In that event, the Lender will have all of the rights and remedies provided by the Loan
            Documents; and
      B. I understand that the Loan Documents will not be modified unless and until (i) the Lender accepts
            this Agreement by signing and returning a copy of it to me, and (ii) the Modification Effective Date
            (as defined in Section 3) has occurred. I further understand and agree that the Lender will not be
            obligated or bound to make any modification of the Loan Documents if I fail to meet any one of
            the requirements under this Agreement.
3. The Modification. If my representations and covenants in Section 1 continue to be true in all
      material respects and all preconditions to the modification set forth in Section 2 have been met, the
      Loan Documents will automatically become modified on June 1, 2019 (the “Modification Effective

"14","     to make any payments as a precondition to this modification under a trial period plan, this
     modification will not take effect. The first modified payment will be due on June 1, 2019.
     A. The Maturity Date will be: December 1, 2029.
     B. The modified principal balance of my Note will include all amounts and arrearages that will be
          past due as of the Modification Effective Date (including unpaid and deferred interest, fees,
          escrow advances and other costs, but excluding unpaid late charges, collectively, ""Unpaid

          principal balance of my Note will be $27,311.68 (the ""New Principal Balance""). I understand that
          by agreeing to add the Unpaid Amounts to the outstanding principal balance, the added Unpaid
          Amounts accrue interest based on the interest rate in effect under this Agreement. I also
          understand that this means interest will now accrue on the unpaid Interest that is added to the
          outstanding principal balance, which would not happen without this Agreement.

          modified Loan will be the minimum payment that will be due each month for the remaining term of
          the Loan. My modified Loan will not have a negative amortization feature that would allow me to
          pay less than the interest due resulting in any unpaid interest being added to the outstanding
          principal balance.

          escrow advances and other costs, but excluding unpaid late charges, collectively, ""Unpaid

          principal balance of my Note will be $27,311.68 (the ""New Principal Balance""). I understand that
          by agreeing to add the Unpaid Amounts to the outstanding principal balance, the added Unpaid
          Amounts accrue interest based on the interest rate in effect under this Agreement. I also

Mortgage on the Property, and (2) the Note secured by the Mortgage. The Mortgage and Note together,
as they may previously have been amended, are referred to as the “Loan Documents.” Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement and not defined have the meaning given to them in Loan Documents.
I understand that after I sign and return two copies of this Agreement to the Lender, the Lender will send
me a signed copy of this Agreement. This Agreement will not take effect unless the preconditions set
forth in Section 2 have been satisfied.

      C. There has been no impermissible change in the ownership of the Property since I signed the
            Loan Documents. A permissible change would be any transfer that the lender is required by law

            undersigned in the event of a death, divorce or marriage;
            Under penalty of perjury, all documents and information I have provided to Lender in connection
            with this Agreement, including the documents and information regarding my eligibility for the , are
            true and correct;
            If Lender requires me to obtain credit counseling in connection with the Program, I will do so; and
            I have made or will make all payments required under a trial period plan.
           In the event that I was discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding subsequent to the
           execution of the loan documents and did not reaffirm the mortgage debt under applicable law,
           Lender agrees that I will not have personal liability on the debt pursuant to this Agreement.
2. Acknowledgements and Preconditions to Modification. I understand and acknowledge that:
      A. If prior to the Modification Effective Date as set forth in Section 3 the Lender determines that any
            of my representations in Section 1 are no longer true and correct or any covenant in Section 1
            has not been performed, the Loan Documents will not be modified and this Agreement will

            Documents; and

            this Agreement by signing and returning a copy of it to me, and (ii) the Modification Effective Date
            (as defined in Section 3) has occurred. I further understand and agree that the Lender will not be
            obligated or bound to make any modification of the Loan Documents if I fail to meet any one of
            the requirements under this Agreement.
3. The Modification. If my representations and covenants in Section 1 continue to be true in all
      material respects and all preconditions to the modification set forth in Section 2 have been met, the
      Loan Documents will automatically become modified on June 1, 2019 (the “Modification Effective

          pay less than the interest due resulting in any unpaid interest being added to the outstanding
